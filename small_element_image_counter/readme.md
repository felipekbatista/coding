### Images

There is a directory with example pictures of what this code intends to measure. It contains 4 pictures of salt grains and one of coins. 

Check the example_images directory for having an idea of the kind of objects it can count.

> Note: if you will take a picture, for a good picture, be sure that the background of the object is the most simple and plain as possible (single collor background is the perfect)

> the salt grains pictures are not the most perfect type of image because it has several glare in the backgound (when I took the pictures I had only that surface)

### Code

Download the code and insert it into a specific directory

If you want, insert the images you want analyze in the same directory (imgs must be .jpg)

Run the code

**input**

- images path

  > hit enter if the images are in the same directory as the code

- csv filename

  > name of the output csv filename

**output**

The output is a csv file named with the input csv filename you chose

The output csv file has the following parameters of each counted object and its respective unity, pixels

- area (pixelÂ²)
- labels (integer number)
- perimeter (pixel)
- major axis length (pixel)
- minor axis length (pixel)
- equivalent diameter (pixel)
